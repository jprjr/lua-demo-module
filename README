# lua-demo-module

This is just a silly example lua module written in C, I used this to
figure out how to create a C module that works in Lua and LuaJIT,
as well as with Lua/LuaJIT embedded into a C program.

Files:

* demo.c - the module, compiles to 'demo/core.so' and 'demo/core.a'
* demo.lua - the loader, it will load 'demo/core.so'
* main.c - the app
* main.lua - the lua app
